# Description:
- To implement Character Device Driver to list processes using Kernel programming.

# Plan of action (as on 03/16/2020):
- Currently, I am looking at various online resources that would help me understand kernel programming.

- I have added two files (Note: Partial code has been written):
    
    > user_ps.c - For creating dev/process_list character device that returns the information for all currently running processes.

    > user.c - For opening the character device and printing the list of processes retrieved from the character device.

- Most of the time would be spent in understanding basic kernel programming, after which I would be able to move ahead with the feature implementation.

- After understanding the basic concepts of Kernel Programming, I will continue with developing the first part of the assignment of creating the character device, following which I will work on the development of the next part of the assignment.

- As of now, I plan to complete the assignment by the given due date : 03/27/2020

# Compling the program:
- (Need to work on the program)

# Executing the program:
- (Need to work on the program)

# Cleaning the executable:
- make clean
